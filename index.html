							<h2>American Airlines expands its US flight schedule for July</h2>

							<p>New York (CNN Business)The airlines' summer travel season won't be as busy or profitable as last year's. But it's looking less dire than expected.
								American Airlines (AAL) is seeing "improving demand for air travel," the company said Thursday, prompting it to plan a sizable increase in flights for July. American will fly 55% of its normal domestic schedule next month — a huge jump from the 20% of normal that it flew in May.
								According to American, flying turned a corner in May. The number of customers it was flying daily surged to about 110,000, which was a 71% increase from April. The percentage of seats filled on every flight grew to 55% for the last week of May, up 15% from the average in April.
								That mirrors recent data from Transportation Security Administration, which said earlier this week that it screened nearly 949,000 passengers last weekend. That's a large increase from the 476,000 people it screened over the first weekend of May 2020. But in May 2019 roughly 2 million passengers passed through security checkpoints daily, according to TSA data.
							Still, American's more robust schedule is providing some optimism for a battered industry: Shares soared as much as 30% in early trading.</p>

							<h2>American Airlines Announces Cargo-Only Flights to Help Keep Business Moving</h2>
							
							<a target="_blank" href="http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/American-Airlines-Announces-Cargo-Only-Flights-to-Help-Keep-Business-Moving-OPS-DIS-03/default.aspx"><img src="img/social-American-Airlines-generic-25.jpg" alt=""></a>
							<p>FORT WORTH, Texas — American Airlines is utilizing its currently grounded passenger aircraft to move cargo between the United States and Europe, ensuring the world’s goods continue to get where they need to go.
								The first cargo-only flight departs from Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) tomorrow, March 20, landing at Frankfurt Airport (FRA) March 21. The Boeing 777-300 will operate two round trips between DFW and FRA over the course of four days, carrying only cargo and necessary flight personnel. This is the first scheduled cargo-only flight since 1984 when American retired the last of its Boeing 747 freighters. The 777-300 has 14 cargo positions for large pallets and can carry more than 100,000 pounds. The four scheduled flights this weekend are expected to be booked to capacity and transport medical supplies, mail for active U.S. military, telecommunications equipment and electronics that will support people working from home, and e-commerce packages. The flights provide much-needed cargo capacity for many of the airline’s regular cargo customers, allowing them to continue operating in this challenging environment.
							Air cargo has always played a key role in times of crisis, delivering lifesaving medical supplies and materials to keep the world’s infrastructure intact. In the face of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, this role has never been more important as the world relies more on e-commerce to support basic needs during quarantines and social distancing. The airlines’ role is deemed a critical infrastructure industry by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

							<h2>This entry-level Lamborghini offers more fun for a lot less money</h2>

							<p>(CNN)Lamborghini's new Huracán Evo RWD is the Italian auto maker's least expensive supercar -- and it is also the most enjoyable one to drive.
								The base price for the Huracán Evo starts at about $208,000, which is still outlandishly expensive by ordinary standards. Still, it's much less than the next cheapest Huracán, which starts at about $260,000, or the V12-powered Avantador which can't be had for any less than about $420,000. Only the Lamborghini Urus SUV can be bought for around the Huracan Evo RWD's starting price. Of course, the starting price on a Lamborghini leaves a long way to go. Option costs can add up with startling speed.
								For example, the Huracan Evo RWD I test drove cost $285,000. That included an optional $14,000 pearlescent yellow paint job. Photographs don't quite capture the lustrous impact of the color but, trust me, if there was ever yellow paint worth $14,000, this is it. Still, you could get your Huracán in red, white, or some shade of yellow that doesn't look like delicious melted butter on top of Pirelli tires. That's up to you.
							Sports seats added another $7,500 and a system that raised the nose of the car to clear speed bumps and curb cuts another $7,100.</p>

							<h2>Dallas Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones Splashes Out on Superyacht</h2>

							<p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has taken his state’s unofficial slogan to heart: Go big or go home.
								The billionaire businessman is the new owner of a custom superyacht roughly the length of a football field, at 357 feet, which Mr. Jones got to take out for a cruise in time for the holidays. Dutch yacht builder Oceanco delivered the fuel-efficient ship to its "proud owners" a few days before Christmas, the builder announced.

								Mr. Jones, 76—whose net worth is valued at $6.8 billion—reportedly spent $250 million on the impressive yacht, $110 million more than he paid for the NFL team in 1989. Mansion Global could not independently confirm the final price. Oceanco and naval engineering firm Lateral rolled out a new energy-efficient design concept for the superyacht, named "Bravo Eugenia" after Mr. Jones’s wife, Genie. The ship has a single-tiered engine room, which allows for the ship’s slender design and more room for guest accommodations, according to the builder. The sleek white superyacht has two helipads and ample storage space for the owner’s large selection of water toys, according to the builder. There’s also a suite of spa amenities, including its own massage room, sauna, steam room and plunge pool. The lower deck encompasses a gym and a luxurious "beach club," a yachting term for the ship’s waterside lounge.

							<p>New York (CNN Business)After three months of massive order cancellations for new jets, the bad news on canceled orders continued -- but slowed -- for Boeing in May.
							Boeing's deliveries ground to a near halt. But the company reported only 14 canceled orders for the troubled 737 Max last month. Boeing reported 46 canceled orders in February, followed by 150 in March and 108 in April, as the the world's airlines' finances crumbled. Air travel ground to a near halt during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
